# 🚀 About Me

I am a **Machine Learning & MLOps Engineer** passionate about building **end-to-end production ML systems** on cloud infrastructure.

I specialize in taking models from:

> notebook → pipeline → API → Docker → CI/CD → AWS deployment

Most of my work focuses on **real-world ML engineering**, system design, and scalable deployment rather than theoretical experimentation.

### 🔭 Current Focus

* Production-grade ML systems
* Cloud deployment (AWS)
* CI/CD for ML
* FastAPI model serving
* LLM + RAG systems (next phase)

### 🎯 Career Goal

To work as a **Machine Learning / MLOps Engineer** building scalable AI systems used by real users globally.

# 📦 ML Engineering Philosophy

I focus on:

* Writing production-quality code
* Building reproducible pipelines
* Automating ML workflows
* Deploying scalable APIs
* Monitoring and improving models

> “A model in a notebook is a prototype.
> A deployed model is real engineering.”
